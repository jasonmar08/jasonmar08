As a software engineer with a background collaborating in biological sciences and healthcare, I find satisfaction in empathetic work that incorporates evidence-based solutions and transparent set goals. I frequently challenge myself to update my repertoire of technical practices with the latest advancements in science and tech, while applying these skills to a personalized proposal that prioritizes the individual needs of clients.
